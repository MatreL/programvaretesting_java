In the program we already have the inputs, so the program will run in the main class. 

- The different exercises are put into programs
- When ran, the program will list the different exercises, and the intensity, duration, repetitions, and equipment of each exercise.
- We have a method that will tell the user the total duration of the program, including resting time. We also have a method that will check if the program is balanced or not, and what the highest intensity will be. 
- The user will be able to input his preferred exercise and acceptable intensity, and the exercise manager will look through the programs to find the most suited program for the user.
